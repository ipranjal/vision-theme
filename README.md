Vision theme for elgg

Vision theme is slightly inspired by Facebook theme , it brings 3 column theme support to elgg. Vision Theme has the following features :

Header colour can be changed from plugin settings
Advertisement can be enabled and disabled and configured from settings 
Most features of theme can be turned on and off via settings
All activity feed is turned card based 
Few css tweaks and improvements added
For best experience The wire pro (https://elgg.org/plugins/3079200) is recommended to be used along with this theme to give "facebook theme" like experience.

If you like this theme and want me to continue building plugins & themes like these please drop a recommendation. Drop a suggestion in comment if you like to see any new feature .
